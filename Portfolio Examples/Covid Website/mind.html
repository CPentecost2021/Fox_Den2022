    <h1>Tips for a Healthy Mental State</h1>

    <h2>Here are a few things that you can do to keep a positive outlook during self isolation.</h2>

    <div class="orderedlist">
        <p>Nature.com gives 7 things to keep your mental health in a good state from Clinical Psycologist Desiree Dickerson.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Manage your expectations</li>
            <li>Proactively manage your stress threshold</li>
            <li>Know your Red Flags</li>
            <li>Routine is your friend</li>
            <li>Be compassionate with yourself and with others</li>
            <li>Maintain connections</li>
            <li>Manage uncertainty by staying in the present</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>So with 7 things to look into I would like to focus on 3 main items that I find that help me in these times.  
        Having a Routine, Be Compassionate with yourself and others and Managing my Expectations.</p>
    <p>When creating a routine I try to give myself a few tasks each particular time of the day. 
        I divided my time up to Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, Early Evening and Evening.  I schedule about 3-4 items
        that I try to complete or do to make sure I am being productive but also giving myself some needed away time, since I am
        working from home.</p>
    <br>
    <table class="table" style="width:100%">
        <tr><th colspan=3>Creating a Routine</th></tr> 
        <tr>
            <th>Early Morning</th>
            <th>Morning</th> 
            <th>Afternoon</>
            <th>Early evening</th> 
            <th>Evening</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wake up at 5:30 am</td>
            <td>Make Coffee</td>
            <td>Lunch</td>

            <td>Mediate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Check Social Media/play a game on my phone</td>
            <td>Make sure the Kids have breakfast</td>
            <td>Stretch/Small AB workout</td>
            <td>Have a walk outside/Kids bike ride</td>
            <td>Course work/Workout</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Have a Shower and get dressed</td>
            <td>Start work</>
            <td>Back to work</td>
            <td>Check Social Media/Personal Emails</td>
            <td>Bedtime</td>
        </tr>

    <p>Being Compassionate to yourself and others is a great way to feel better about the situation 
        you are in. In the news, social media and everyday life we are all dealing with the same 
        issues and stress. How we take that stress and turn it into positive energy is up to each 
        of us to figure it out. What does help is dealing with those around us with a lot of compassion.
        Knowing that everyone is going through the same thing should help us all realize that we are in 
        this together.  Being helpful, charitable and understanding with yourself is about giving 
        yourself time to meditate - I highly recommend the App Headspace - and removing the stress 
        from your mind will help give you some peace and help you fall asleep easier.</p>

    <p>I find the best thing that you can do manage your expectations is by creating a mantra.  I will 
        link an article from <a href="http://www.oprah.com/inspiration/how-to-create-your-own-personal-mantra">Oprah.com.</a>
        This has a recipe to create your own mantra.  By creating your own mantra with the items that will 
        help keep you in a positive frame of mind and focused on managing your life while stuck in your home.</p>

    <p>On the next page we will show you some workouts that can help you keep in shape while the gyms are closed.</p>
