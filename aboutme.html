              <p>The First Lesson about IT is that Coffee is your Best friend.  It maybe what keeps you awake through those long planning meetings or is a catalyst for a lively discussion about processes.  Coffee is Life.</p>
              <p>Also if you are in IT and Share a Coffee maker with any other department you will be come the barista at your company. So if things don't work out you can always work at a coffee shop.</p>

              <p>I hope that soon we as a family will be able to take up more outdoor sports like kayaking, paddle boarding, and camping(or glamping for my wife Cindy).</p>
