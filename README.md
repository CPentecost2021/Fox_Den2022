# Fox_Den2022

This is a ongoing project for personal developement.
Foxes is a reference to Japanese folklore, kitsune (狐, キツネ, IPA: [kʲi̥t͡sɯne̞] (listen)), are foxes that possess paranormal abilities that increase as they get older and wiser. According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers.

Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan;this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.

The Den is a room in a house or apartment, used for activities not involving work or a house where Animals Live...I see this as a safe space to create this site.

The Fox Den is a place where I can increase my knowledge of Web Development by creating web applications and pages and even a blog about a few things happening in my life. This adds an aura of accountability for me and my learning and self development.
