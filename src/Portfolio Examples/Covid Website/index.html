                <p>Everyday you see the same 4 walls, drink the same coffee and see the same people.  
                    But you are not at work dealing with a nagging boss and gossiping co-workers.  
                    You are at home.  Maybe alone, maybe with your family. All you know is you are 
                    here for the long haul.  This may mean days, weeks or even months of being here, 
                    within these 4 walls working, playing, sleeping and living.  If you can call 
                    that living.</p>

                    <p>Things around you have changed.  Since the outbreak in North America of the Covid-19 Virus 
                    people have been asked to stay at home and social distance themselves from those around 
                    them to help flatten the curve of infection.  If you are like me this has meant working 
                    from home.  Not visiting friends or loved ones.  All the time wondering why do I need to 
                    flatten a curve?  Why is it important?  Here is a video from the McFarland Clinic 
                    on what the curve is and why we need to flatten the curve.</p>

                    <p>To help get you through this time of social distancing I have put together some 
                        information as to what happens to your mind and body in times of isolation.  How 
                        your mind and body try to cope with being isolated for prolonged periods of time. 
                        As well as provide you with ways to keep your self healthy physically and mentally 
                        I will also provide you with links to the various people and services that can help you navigate this time.</p>
