	<h2>The Gym</h2>
	<p>Words that can be as scary as "Hey you wanna go stay in the haunted house for a week?" It is not as easy as most people think.  As a person who has struggled with his weight for most of my life I have learned that alot of the issues are deeply ingrained in how I feel and what makes me happy.  I had never worked out before except for riding my bike outside and goign for the odd walk in nature.  The Machines were all strange to me.  As someone who (again aging myself) remembers Dennis Leary's comic bit about exercise and the stairmaster...I really wondered why I was there.  Oh yeah I worked for the Gym.  It jump started my fitness journey.  Now 18 years on and I now have a trainer Lisle, the Evil Coach. As well as a new drive to be as healthy as I can be.  With 2 children at home and a pandemic raging has renewed a fire to get myself in a better place.  I look forward to embracing in sharing my successes and failures. Join me going forward on this journey to find a balance of health.</p>

		<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>For my first food post I wanted to introduce you to a delicious and easy recipe for a Pancetta Cream Sauce.  As I am continuing to learn how to utilize new technology (at least to me), Here is my first take at Vlogging me cooking.  I hope to learn more about Adobe's Premire Pro to get a smoother transitioned video.</p>

		<h2>Personal Development</h2>
		<p>The journey starts with the first step. Like Bill Murray in What About Bob? baby steps are a great way to start.  I got to a point in my career where I relyed too much on the software developers to explain how things worked. Which always led me to ask more questions. I felt like the tortise in the race to get things out the door. So I looked for ways to learn.  Ways to expand on what I was being taught aon the job.  I am used to doing things backwards, so when I finally signed up for my first web development course I was nervous.  I have never taken an online course, never had to be as self driven with reading and understanding new concepts without being able to face to face ask questions.  It was frusterating at first but it soon became easier.  A lot of the concepts that should have been new to me were vaguely familiar and soon the pieces started to fit like a a pro tetris game.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I will admit there are still things about development that I still do not understand.  But there are things I can now look at and not see Neo's first look at the Matrix.  The code is bringing into focus the world behind the screen.  I look forward to continuing these posts.  The first like Baby Steps are small, but I hope to delve deeper into my journey through Web Developement to UI/UX Design. </p>

				Covid 19 Quarantine

			<h2>My time in Quarantine</h2>
			<p>It took over a year, wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart, washing my hands frequently, being very careful...we finally had a close contact with a person who became Covid-19 Positive.  What did that Mean?  Well it meant our entire family was off to get a Covid-19 Test.  Once the Test was done then it was 2 weeks in the house.  Yup 2 weeks of being around the house.  Around day 2 it became interesting.  I have dealt with Depression and Anxiety most of my life.  I will get more into that in a later post, but it makes waiting for results more difficult.  Luckily we had our results back in less than 2 days.  We were all Negative.  YEAH!!!  But we needed to stay in quarantine for the rest of the 14 days. 2 whole weeks in lock down in our house...couldn't really go out.  It had been raining a lot, it was cool temperatures which made going for a walk with 2 small children more of a chore than exercise and a break from the monotony inside the house.  Cindy (my wife) and I tried our best to make a horrible situation better for ourselves and out kids - without breaking the bank.  Luckily this was also during Ontario's most recent stay at home order so we really weren't missing much on the outside. Playdoh, colouring books, Family game time with the switch helped break up the days.  Most of the time the kids would use their tablets to watch their favourite cartoons.  While I tried to finish up my last web development class and getting this blog up and running. Interspersed with being fortunate(or not so fortunate, depends on the day) to being able to work from home and home schooling our oldest. Even though we made it through and did our duty to stay in and away from people until the quarantine period was over, it makes me wonder how many actually do the full quarantine?  It is not easy especially when you see all of the anti lockdown protest and those on social media who just want things to go back to normal.  I understand in time I will have some semblance of normalcy but to go back to fully normal I think is not possible. I would like to be proven wrong.</p>

		<h2>The Beginning of a New Directon</h2>
		<p>Robert Frost wrote a poem about being at a crossroads and taking the path less travelled.  I have finally come to that crossroads for me and I am stuck.  I have been stuck since May.  I have been fighting with myself over which direction to go in and it has started to take its toll on my mental anxiety.  I have thought about where I would like my career to go.  I have researched, I have youtubed, I have read articles, I have talked to associates of mine.  I am still nowhere close to making a decision and it is now September.</p>
		</br>
		<p>The leaves are now changing colour, the nights are getting longer and I still am not sure how I want to take my first step forward.  Do I focus on my life as a QA, learning automation and trying to find a meaningful jobs as a Test Engineer.  Do I move over to DevOps and learn more Programs to expand my knowledge on piplines to production.  Or do I make a complete 180 and give up the idea of continuing on in technology.  Its a hard decision that gets harder each day I get closer to not having EI.</p>
		</br>
		<p>These are questions I can only answer myself. Even with all the pros and cons the decision is still nowhere close to being answered. I have been struggling with this question even as I have progessed in cleaning up my non professional life.  I have started to declutter both my own life as well as our families.  I have started to focus on balancing my beliefs, mindset, my physical self and still I have not been able to figure out the career thing.</p>
		</br>
		<p>I expect to go deeper into this over the next few posts.  I want to use this as my own soundboard and be able to make a decision soon.</p>
